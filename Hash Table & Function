Generally, hash table is used to quickly determine whether an element is in a set.
Use hashCode to turn xxx into 
Map different inputs to unique, fixed-length values

index = hashFunction(name)
hashFunction = hashCode(name) % tableSize


1. Hash Collisions
 Different inputs get the same hash.
 To address
 (1) Open Hashing
 (2) Linear Probing
 
2. Three hash structure
 (1) Array
 (2) Set
 (3) Map

Hashing trades space for time.
